+ **Project summary**: Airplane is a popular transportation tool. In this project, we developed a new app called AirPlan which helps people plan their flights and learn more about different airlines. In particular, we focus on 14 major US airlines and offer a comparison between the regions they cover, their on-time performance, safety performance, luggage handling, service, and price. Unlike traditional airline planning websites which mainly focus on service or price, we cover more factors people might be interested in and help them make better and efficient decisions.
